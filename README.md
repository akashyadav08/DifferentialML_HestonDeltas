# DSMMasterProject23

Project by: Elain Balderas, Nina McClure, Akash Yadav

##Goal of the project

The goal of this Master Project is to apply the neural networks architecture to the computations of options Greeks that are important for the hedging of options. This is not straightforward since differentiating directly the network does not provide good results. Instead one could use the novel approach developed by Huge and Savine on Differential Machine Learning.
